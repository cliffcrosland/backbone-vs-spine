backbone-vs-spine
=================

Quick mockups of Todos app - to compare Backbone and Spine.

Look at assets/js/app.coffee.

Next step: run Todos on Mongo, look for snags or awkwardness.

Eg. To run the Spine app on localhost:3000:

    $ cd spine-todos/
    $ npm install
    $ cake dev      # watches and compiles assets as you edit them
